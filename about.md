Currently, I'm at Facebook in NYC working on [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) infrastructure. A typical day consists of using all of C++, Objective-C, Java, Rust, Python, and TypeScript (and sometimes Hack). I previously interned at Facebook in MPK, working on a kernel userspace team on [network block devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device). 

I went to school in Ann Arbor, where I studied [Math](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/honors-mathematics.html) and [Computer Science](https://eecs.umich.edu/eecs/undergraduate/computer-science/) with a minor in [Philosophy](https://lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/undergraduates.html).

In my free time, I enjoy playing and listening to [music]({{site.url}}music). I played violin in a [few](http://uac.umich.edu/mpo/) [different](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/campus-orchestras/home) orchestras at school, and drove various incarnations of [bureaucracy](https://honors.engin.umich.edu/about/honors-student-advisory-board/).

I've been looking into more [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) recently. I'm also following along some of the progress on [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and [Jai](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jai/). On the more academic side, I've also been reading about type theory and category theory (plus some good old SICP).

You can find me at **jonathoma.me** at the search company email site.
