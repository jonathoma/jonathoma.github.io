I grew up in [Grand Rapids, MI](http://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Rapids,+MI/), where I attended [Forest Hills Eastern High School](https://www.fhps.net/high-schools/eastern/). 

After graduating in 2015, I have since moved to Ann Arbor, MI to attend school at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), where I am pursuing a double major in [Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/honors-mathematics.html) and [Computer Science](https://eecs.umich.edu/eecs/undergraduate/computer-science/) with a minor in [Philosophy](https://lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/undergraduates.html).

Currently, I am interning as a Summer Technology Analyst for [JP Morgan Chase & Co Digital](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy playing and listening to [music]({{site.url}}music). I am a first violinist in the University of Michigan [Campus Symphony Orchestra](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/campus-orchestras/home) as well as the [Michigan Pops Orchestra](http://uac.umich.edu/mpo/). I also serve as a member of the [Engineering Honors Student Advisory Board](https://honors.engin.umich.edu/about/honors-student-advisory-board/). I also like to read classics, poetry, and philosophy. I am trying to teach myself the basics of Haskell and category theory in my free time, as well as work on some side projects involving [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) to teach myself more about neural networks.

Please [contact me]({{site.url}}contact) if you have any questions or concerns!
