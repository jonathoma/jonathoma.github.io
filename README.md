Hi! This is the github repo for my personal website, built using Github Pages, Jekyll, and Hyde. To learn more about me, please visit my site at <jonathoma.github.io>. You can also reach out to me with any questions you have about the site at <jonthoma@umich.edu>. Thanks!

# Hyde

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
