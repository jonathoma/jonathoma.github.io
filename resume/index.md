I grew up in [Grand Rapids, MI](http://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Rapids,+MI/), where I attended [Forest Hills Eastern High School](https://www.fhps.net/high-schools/eastern/). After graduating in 2015, I have since moved to Ann Arbor, MI to attend school at the University of Michigan, where I am pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Philosophy.

Currently, I am interning as a Summer Technology Analyst for [JP Morgan Chase & Co](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/). 

In my free time, I enjoy playing and listening to music. I am a first violinist in the University of Michigan Campus Symphony Orchestra as well as the Michigan Pops Orchestra. I also like to read classics, poetry, and philosophy. I am trying to teach myself the basics of Haskell and category theory in my free time, as well as start some side projects.

Please [contact me](http://jonathoma.github.io/contact) if you have any questions or concerns!
