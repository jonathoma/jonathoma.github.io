I love listening to all types of music. Some genres that resonate in particular: **techno**, **indie**, **hip-hop**, **shoegaze** and **(post)punk**.

You can find some of the stuff I've been into recently over at either my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/1246063368) or [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/jonathanthomas3) accounts. 

Here's a Spotify playlist I try to keep updated with some current recommendations.
